  <div>
    Welcome, fellow traveler of the digital frontier. I am <b>0xrh0d4m1n</b>, a hacker, a builder, and a defender of the digital commons. I operate at the intersection of <b>cybersecurity, open-source, and digital sovereignty</b>, a place where freedom is measured in bits, and anonymity is not a crime, but a right.
    <br><br>
    Nowadays, where mass surveillance has become the norm, where centralization threatens autonomy, and where the balance of power tilts toward those who control information, I stand for <b>decentralization, privacy, and the hacker ethos</b>.
    <br><br>
    This space is my digital manifesto, a small place of my insights, tools, and knowledge for those who seek to <b>secure, defend, and freedom</b>. If you are here, chances are you are part of the resistance, whether you know it yet or not.

## :satellite: **My Mission**

The fight for privacy is not about hiding, it is about maintaining **control over our own lives**. True hackers are **builders**, not just breakers; they **create** systems that empower rather than enslave.

I dedicate this space to the **preservation of digital freedom**, sharing:  
- **Practical cybersecurity knowledge** for those who seek to defend themselves;  
- **Writeups and analyses** of real-world attacks and vulnerabilities;  
- **Cryptographic wisdom** which is not an option anymore, but a necessity;  
- **Open-source software and tools** to fight against digital oppression.  

This is a place for **builders, defenders, and rebels**. If you believe in a future where privacy is a fundamental right, where cryptography is not a crime, and where open-source is the foundation of security, then you are home my friend.
